# Dotfiles

## To do:

- Create one script to run all scripts in order
- Create init.sh script to install awesomewm-git and luarocks
- Symlink 10-monitors.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitors.conf

## Install

- Clone this repo and `cd` into it

```
git clone https://github.com/notlad-p/dotfiles.git
```

From here you have 2 options:

1. You can install, symlink, and clone everything with one script called `init.sh`

```
. ./init.sh
```

2. You can install, symlink, and clone separately with `install.sh`, `symlink.sh`, and `clone.sh`

```
. ./install.sh
. ./symlink.sh
. ./clone.sh
```
